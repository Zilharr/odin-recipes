    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>German apple cake is a moist, dense cake that keeps well. It has been a family favorite for 20 years.<br>
     Serve with a dusting of confectioners' sugar or topped with a cream cheese frosting.</p>
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>4 cups apples - peeled, cored and diced</li>
     </ul>

     <h2>Directions</h2>

     <ol>
        <li>Preheat the over to 350<sup>o</sup>F. Grease and flour a 9x13-inch cake pan.</li>
        <br>
